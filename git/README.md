# Git

Exercise:
Groups of 3. Nominate Maintainer, Contributor A, and Contributor B.

Maintainer creates a repo on Github.
Maintainer adds 2 commits and pushes.
Contributor A and Contributor B fork and clone (and add upstream).
Contributor A and Contributor B create a feature branch called `will_need_split.
Contributor A and Contributor B add four commits of four files on will_need_split
Contributor A and Contributor B create a pull request to upstream from their will_need_split branch (including all four commits).
Maintainer rejects the pull request, closing it and commenting “please split this up” (and direct which files go together, probably 2 in each.)
Contributor A and Contributor B follow procedure above to end up with two new branches split_branch_1 and split_branch_2 send through separate pull requests with only the right commits/files in them.
Maintainer eventually accepts each of the four split up pull requests.
