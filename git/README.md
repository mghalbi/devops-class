Exercise:

- Maintainer creates a repo on Github.
- Maintainer adds 2 commits and pushes.
- create a feature branch called `will_need_split.
- add four commits of four files on will_need_split
- create a pull request to upstream from their will_need_split branch (including all four commits).
- Maintainer eventually accepts each of the four split up pull requests.
